class="cmr-10">The most important diﬀerences are, ﬁrst, that this model incorporates shocks to</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">permanent income, while the HSZ model has only transitory (but very persistent) shocks (they</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">estimate an AR(1) coeﬃcient greater than .90); second, this model ignores health risks; third, I</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">assume that in every period there is a small (p = .03) and serially uncorrelated chance of</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">unemployment; and, ﬁnally, I do not extensively model the social welfare system that applies to</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">households at the bottom of the income distribution. (However, I assume that unemployment</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">insurance replaces 50 percent of permanent income for unemployed consumers). HSZ found</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">that labor income risk was far more important than health risk in determining the</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">age proﬁle of wealth and saving, and the details of the social welfare system are not</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">very important in determining the behavior of the median households (much less the</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">rich households). Hence these modelling diﬀerences should not matter much for my</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">purposes. I have adopted HSZ’s assumptions about parameter values: time preference rate</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">equal to the interest rate at 3 percent annually; coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">of 3; and a similar age/income proﬁle. The deﬁnition of ‘permanent income’ here is</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">the annual income that a household would receive if there were no transitory shocks</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">to income. Except for the incorporation of unemployment insurance and stochastic</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">mortality, and the use here of HSZ parameter values, this model is the same as that in</span>
