<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   This paper considers several alternative explanations for the fact that
households with higher levels of lifetime income (‘the rich’) have higher
lifetime saving rates (Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes <a 
href="#Xdsz:richsave">Dynan et al.</a> [<a 
href="#Xdsz:richsave">1996</a>];
Lillard and Karoly <a 
href="#Xlillard&karoly:richsave">Lillard and Karoly</a> [<a 
href="#Xlillard&karoly:richsave">1997</a>]). The paper argues that the
saving behavior of the richest households cannot be explained by models
in which the only purpose of wealth accumulation is to ﬁnance future
consumption, either their own or that of heirs. The paper concludes that the
simplest model that explains the relevant facts is one in which either
consumers regard the accumulation of wealth as an end in itself, or unspent
wealth yields a ﬂow of services (such as power or social status) which
have the same practical eﬀect on behavior as if wealth were intrinsically
desirable.

<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >The saving behavior of the wealthy has received remarkably little academic
attention in the past twenty years or so. This is probably largely attributable to a
relative lack of good data: The <span 
class="cmti-12">Survey of Consumer Finances </span>is virtually the only
publicly available source of detailed data on wealthy households, and even the
SCF has only a few hundred really wealthy households in each triennial
wave. Despite recent neglect, the topic is an important one for scholars
of saving behavior, for at least two reasons. First, wealthy households
should provide a powerful means of testing whether the standard model
of consumer behavior, the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis, is
adequate as a universal model of saving and consumption. This is an
application of the general scientiﬁc principle that models should be tested under
extreme conditions; if they do not hold up, a new model (or an extended
version of the old one) is called for. The second reason for studying the
wealthy is that they account for a large share of aggregate wealth. In fact,
some understanding of the saving behavior of the wealthy is probably
indispensable to any credible attempt to account for the magnitude of aggregate
                                                                          

                                                                          
wealth.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Although the primary source of evidence in this paper will be the four <span 
class="cmti-12">Surveys</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">of Consumer Finances </span>conducted in 1983, 1989, 1992, and 1995, the inevitable
limitations of those data will be apparent. The paper therefore also relies to a
considerable extent on unorthodox kinds of evidence, ranging from information in
the annual <span 
class="cmti-12">Forbes 400 </span>tabulation of the richest American households, to
quotations from and about the very rich, to the results of a “focus group” meeting
with a set of wealthy individuals who were directly asked their reasons for
saving.
<!--l. 137--><p class="indent" >   The paper begins by considering whether the standard model of household
consumption and saving decisions, the Life Cycle model, provides an adequate
description of the behavior of wealthy households. I argue that the Life Cycle
model, or at least the traditional incarnation in which the decision-maker saves
mainly to ﬁnance his own future consumption, cannot simultaneously explain
both the behavior of the median household and the behavior in the upper tail of
the wealth distribution. The next section of the paper considers whether a
“Dynastic” model, in which the wealthy save mainly for the beneﬁt of their heirs,
performs better. While the Dynastic model can explain some observations, and
probably does roughly apply to some households, I argue that it still does not
explain some important facts about the saving behavior of the wealthy.
Furthermore, the Dynastic model conﬂicts with the self-reported motives for
saving that many wealthy people voice. Finally, I consider a model in which the
wealthy save because, either directly or indirectly, they obtain greater pleasure
from possessing an extra dollar of wealth than they would get from an extra dollar
of consumption. Following Max Weber <a 
href="#Xweber:capitalism">Weber</a> [<a 
href="#Xweber:capitalism">1905</a>] as interpreted by

href="#Xbakshi&chen:spirit">Bakshi and Chen</a> [<a 
href="#Xbakshi&chen:spirit">1996</a>], I call this the
“Capitalist Spirit” model. I argue that a direct wealth accumulation motive is
indispensable in explaining at least some of the observed behavior of the very
wealthy.

<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >A provocative recent paper by Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes <a 
href="#Xhsz:importance">Hubbard
et al.</a> [<a 
href="#Xhsz:importance">1994</a>] (henceforth, HSZ) argues that an expanded version of the Life Cycle
model in which uncertainty is modelled realistically can generate patterns of
wealth accumulation that are roughly consistent with average data from
household surveys, and amounts of aggregate wealth that are similar to observed
aggregate household wealth in the U.S. If such a model really did produce roughly
correct predictions for household wealth holdings, there would be little need to
study the very wealthy in detail, since they would merely be scaled-up versions of
everyone else.
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   Behind the scenes of the HSZ model, however, all is not well. While it is true
that the model can predict approximately correct average values for wealth or the
wealth-to-income ratio, it achieves this average by making large but oﬀsetting
errors in predicting the underlying distribution of wealth. Speciﬁcally, the HSZ
model predicts, at most ages, that the household with median wealth
actually holds substantially more wealth than the median household in
SCF data holds and, at the same time, the model greatly <span 
class="cmti-12">underpredicts</span>
the amount of wealth held by the households at the top of the wealth

households expect, and experience, zero aggregate productivity growth over their
lifetimes).
<!--l. 282--><p class="indent" >   If assuming that consumers are somewhat more impatient can make the

natural question is whether assuming that consumers are somewhat more <span

can make the model match the richest households. If so, then it might be possible
to argue that the only modiﬁcation needed to make the stochastic Life
Cycle model match the facts is to assume that consumers with higher
lifetime incomes are also more patient. Figure <a 
href="#x1-2006r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:Top1pctWProfilePatientvsSCF --></a> examines this possibility by
showing the pattern of wealth over the working life of consumers who are
the same as the consumers in the baseline HSZ model except that they
have a time preference rate of zero rather than the baseline HSZ time
                                                                          

                                                                          
preference rate of 3 percent annually. While the age/wealth proﬁle is
certainly higher than in the standard HSZ model, it remains far below the
proﬁle for the consumers in the top 1 percent of the SCF data. Plausible
modiﬁcations of other parameter values also fail to raise the model proﬁle to the
level found in the data. In other words, the richest households are saving
more than can be justiﬁed even in a version of the Life Cycle model that
allows for very patient consumers with a strong precautionary saving
motive.

<!--l. 310--><p class="indent" >   The evidence presented thus far has concerned the saving behavior and wealth
proﬁles of consumers during the working period of life. The Life Cycle model has
another set of testable implications for behavior in the latter stages of life, after
retirement. In particular, according to the standard Life Cycle model, even patient
consumers want to spend all of their wealth before they die. Of course, an
uncertain date of death makes this diﬃcult to achieve on one’s own. However,
there is a ﬁnancial instrument which accomplishes exactly the goal implied by the
model: annuities. One test of the rough accuracy of the basic Life Cycle
model is therefore whether the wealth of retired households is largely
annuitized.
<!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   Carrying out such a test requires some methodology for calculating annuity
wealth. I assume that the annuity is ﬁxed in real terms (primarily because the
largest form of annuity income, Social Security, is inﬂation-adjusted). I assume a
real interest rate, and use the mortality tables from HSZ to construct
the expected present discounted value of a one-dollar per year annuity

<!--l. 337--><p class="indent" >   Using this method, and including home equity among annuitized wealth, the
mean household over age 65 has approximately 55 percent of their wealth in
annuitized form. However, among the richest 1 percent of households, the mean
annuitization rate is only 10 percent.
<!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >   This evidence on annuitization is suggestive, but hardly conclusive. Annuity
markets are likely far from perfect; as in other insurance markets, adverse
selection may distort the market suﬃciently to make inference hazardous.
Furthermore, annuities are the perfect ﬁnancial vehicle to counter only one kind of
risk, mortality risk. If other kinds of risk are important, it is no longer obvious
that even selﬁsh Life Cycle consumers should annuitize most or all of their wealth.
For example, if there is a small probability of a very expensive medical problem, it
may be important to have access to a large chunk of nonannuitized wealth in
order to pay the bills (assuming that no health insurance will fully cover every
possible medical catastrophe or every potentially desirable experimental
treatment).
<!--l. 355--><p class="indent" >   An extreme assumption would be that annuity markets are so imperfect that,
                                                                          

                                                                          
for practical purposes, we can assume that annuities cannot be purchased. This
assumption would obviously vitiate the argument that the failure of the wealthy
to annuitize their wealth proves that they are not Life Cyclers. However, in
the absence of annuities the Life Cycle model has other implications. In
particular, it implies that selﬁsh Life Cycle consumers, even patient ones, will
eventually begin running down their wealth as they age. Figure <a 
href="#x1-2009r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:WealthFalls --></a> shows
that by age 80 or so the HSZ model implies that consumers should be
dissaving at a fairly substantial pace (the simulations here follow HSZ’s
assumptions about mortality rates, which they derived from actuarial data,
with the modiﬁcation that they assume that death occurs for certain at
age 100 if it hasn’t happened yet). However, Figure <a 
href="#x1-2010r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:OldRichDontDissave --></a> shows the actual
average age proﬁle of wealth across the four SCF surveys. Although wealth
accumulation slows, or perhaps halts, around age 65, there is no noticeable
decumulation of assets for consumers in the top percentile of the wealth
distribution.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

has drawn a distinction between Dynastic models like the one speciﬁed
in equation <a

income and the child’s lifetime income; that parents should give larger
bequests to poorer children; and that childless wealthy people should
leave no bequests. All of these implications of the Dynastic model have
been tested in population-representative datasets and none has received
consistent empirical support. This section provides evidence that the
Dynastic model is also a poor description of the behavior of the richest

The childless elderly were <span

children, by this crude measure, either as a general rule or in the current year in

children consists of <span

the Life Cycle model is the testimony of the childless, wealthy elderly, essentially

<!--l. 571--><p class="indent" >   Given the paucity of publicly available data on the very wealthy, it is not
surprising that the economic literature contains almost no empirical studies that
shed any light on the behavior of the childless wealthy elderly (although there
have been several studies that have examined the behavior of <span 
class="cmti-12">non-wealthy</span>
childless elderly households, and have found that they do not dissave; see,
e.g., Menchik and David <a 
href="#Xmenchik&david:nodissav">Menchik and David</a> [<a 
href="#Xmenchik&david:nodissav">1983</a>] and the references
therein). I was able to ﬁnd only one study that contains even tangential
information on the subject, a paper by Auten and Joulfaian <a 
href="#Xauten&joulfaian:charitable">Auten and
Joulfaian</a> [<a 
href="#Xauten&joulfaian:charitable">1996</a>] which uses a proprietary dataset compiled by the Internal
Revenue Service on 1982 decedents who paid estate taxes. From ﬁgures
in their Table 1, p. 62 it is possible to calculate that the mean wealth
of the childless decedents was virtually identical to that of those with
children - hardly what would be expected if those with children had a
powerful dynastic saving motive which the childless (presumably) do not
share.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="Why12.html#fn11x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a

Furthermore, those <span 
class="cmti-12">with </span>children actually contributed slightly <span 
class="cmti-12">more </span>to charity
during their lifetimes than the childless. Again, a dynastic motive would suggest
the opposite. Finally, Auten and Joulfaian found no signiﬁcant eﬀect of children’s
                                                                          

                                                                          
income on the size of charitable bequests. This ﬁnding is consistent with evidence
by Wilhelm <a 
href="#Xwilhelm:bequest">Wilhelm</a> [<a 
href="#Xwilhelm:bequest">1996</a>] who found little support for the altruism
model’s implication that the size of bequests in families with more than one
child should be related to the relative lifetime income of the children.
Instead, Wilhelm found roughly equal bequests in about 80 percent of
bequests.

wealth. (The reasons end-of-period wealth might yield utility include the “Joy of

<!--l. 694--><p class="indent" >   The essential insights from this model carry over when the model is extended
to many periods and when labor and capital income are incorporated: consumers
with permanent income below a certain threshhold will behave like standard Life
Cyle consumers and will try to spend all their assets before death, while
consumers with permanent incomes above the threshhold will save at ever
increasing rates as lifetime income rises.
<!--l. 702--><p class="indent" >   The idea that bequests (charitable or otherwise) are insigniﬁcant for most of
the population, but become increasingly important in the upper reaches of the
lifetime income distribution, has been informally expressed by several previous
authors. Indeed, Modigliani <a 
href="#Xmodigliani:nobel">Modigliani</a> [<a 
href="#Xmodigliani:nobel">1986</a>] himself has argued that, to the
extent that bequests must be included in the Life Cycle framework, they should
be incorporated in precisely this “luxury good” manner. There is also a growing
body of empirical evidence in support of the proposition. Dynan, Skinner, and
Zeldes <a 
href="#Xdsz:richsave">Dynan et al.</a> [<a

evidence marshalled above. But such consistency may not be a high enough
standard.

 id="x1-60004.2"></a>Informal Evidence</h4>
<!--l. 732--><p class="noindent" >The essence of Joan Robinson’s complaint about utility theory was that it is
possible to construct a utility function to justify any conceivable behavior: Just
assume that the behavior in question yields more utility than its alternatives. Any
postulated utility function, or proposed modiﬁcation to a standard utility
function, should therefore be defensible on grounds other than its ability to
match the facts it was created to match. This section argues, using a
variety of informal evidence, that most qualitative descriptions of the
behavior of the wealthy, both by the wealthy themselves and by outside
observers, can be interpreted at a fundamental level as implying that
wealthy people derive utility either directly from the ownership of wealth or
indirectly, either from the activities that lead to wealth accumulation
or from a ﬂow of services that is closely tied to the ownership of that
wealth.
<!--l. 747--><p class="indent" >   The ﬁrst important argument about the plausibility of the Capitalist Spirit
model concerns the assumption that the marginal utility of consumption decreases
sharply with the level of consumption. What matters critically here is really the
assumption that there is an alternative way to employ wealth whose marginal
                                                                          

                                                                          
utility decreases more slowly than that of consumption (and hence will be a
luxury good relative to consumption). It is important to recall that the
kind of consumption treated in the model is for strictly nondurable goods
and services. Carroll and Inhaber <a 
href="#XscarrollHowRich">Inhaber and Carroll</a> [<a 
href="#XscarrollHowRich">1992</a>] note that
“luxury” goods that are generally associated with the wealthy such as
art, estates, jewelry – even sports teams – are almost all assets. Indeed,
beyond a certain level of wealth it becomes diﬃcult to imagine how one
could spend even the earnings on one’s wealth on nondurable goods and
services for personal enjoyment. For example, recent press accounts have
estimated Bill Gates’s net worth at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>40 billion. Assuming a ten percent annual
rate of return, Gates would have to spend <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>4 billion a year, or over <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>10
million a day, on nondurable goods and services simply to avoid further
accumulation.
<!--l. 766--><p class="indent" >   The proposition that the marginal utility of consumption approaches zero as
the level of consumption rises is also lent credence by statements of wealthy
people themselves. Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and other fabulously
wealthy people refer to their “surplus” wealth, and of determining when one has
“enough” wealth. H.L. Hunt, then the richest man in the world, once said that
“for practical purposes, someone who has <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>200,000 a year is as well oﬀ as I am.”
Similar statements (appropriately adjusted for inﬂation) have been attributed
to William Henry Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor, two 19th century
plutocrats.
<!--l. 777--><p class="indent" >   One of the appealing features of the idea that rich people eventually reach
near-satiation in their consumption of nondurables is that this means one need
not assume a towering and obsessive greed lies behind their continuing
                                                                          

                                                                          
accumulation. If ‘greed’ is deﬁned as a desire to possess wealth for its own sake,
even a modest amount of greed will suﬃce, so long as greed does not diminish
with wealth as fast as the marginal utility diminishes with consumption. Or, to
put the idea more concretely, if ownership of extra houses, yachts, artwork, or, for
that matter, corporations has even a modest intrinsic appeal, eventually that
appeal is likely to exceed waning lure of an extra dollar of nondurable
consumption. Of course, this is merely another way of saying that ownership of
these kinds of wealth yields utility directly, as the basic Capitalist Spirit model
assumes.

   To the extent that these quotations express the general truth about the
motivations of the wealthy, the Capitalist Spirit model can be said to
apply directly. However, the view that all wealthy people are motivated
solely by a love of wealth for its own sake is surely extreme. A variety of
other plausible, and apparently very diﬀerent, motivations are commonly
proposed, ranging from job satisfaction to status-seeking to philanthropic
ambitions to power-lust. The remainder of this section argues that, from a
modelling standpoint, these other common ideas–diﬀerent though they may be
from a psychological perspective–are essentially indistinguishable from
each other and from the basic Capitalist Spirit model in terms of their
implications for individual behavior. The argument, therefore, is that if <span 
class="cmti-12">any </span>of
these several proposed motivations is correct, the Capitalist Spirit model
constitutes an appropriate mathematical model of the behavior of the
wealthy.

the accumulation of wealth as the principal measure of job performance. This idea
appears frequently both in the statements of the wealthy themselves and in
commentary by others on the behavior of the wealthy. Two particularly direct

For practical purposes of analysis of household-level data, however, either of these
ideas is virtually indistinguishable from the proposition that wealth enters the

in a model of saving (although they might have diﬀerent implications for
optimal tax policy; see the discussion below and the paper by Frank in this

<!--l. 917--><p class="indent" >   This last quotation raises a ﬁnal idea that crops up frequently in the
statements of the wealthy themselves: that the purpose of accumulating wealth is
ultimately to enable the wealthy person to pursue philanthropic activities, or to
establish institutions to carry out such activities. While such an evidently
self-serving interpretation should be subject to considerable skepticism, there are
many prominent examples of philanthropy that bear out the proposition. The
Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie-Mellon University, Duke
University, Johns Hopkins University, the Getty museum, and a host of other
prominent institutions owe either their existence or a substantial part of their
endowments to the muniﬁcence of wealthy individuals (often, although not
always, manifested through bequests). Morally, socially, and psychologically this
motivation for wealth accumulation is very diﬀerent from pure greed.
                                                                          

                                                                          
However, if more wealth allows one to establish a larger foundation or endow
more institutions, the implications for saving behavior are again virtually
indistinguishable from the idea that wealth enters the utility function
directly.

the optimal amount of consumption for consumers facing a 40 percent bequest tax
if bequests are not constrained to be positive. The actual consumption function,
of course, is the minimum of the 45 degree line and this curve. The point of
intersection of this curve and the 45 degree line, labelled <img 
src="Why45x.svg" alt="ω1   " class="math";align="absmiddle">, reveals
the level of lifetime wealth at which consumers begin to leave positive
bequests.
<!--l. 969--><p class="indent" >   When the bequest tax is raised to 80 percent, the amount of consumption
shifts up, as indicated in the curve labelled <img

consumers begin leaving bequests, <img 
src="Why47x.svg" alt="ω2   " class="math";align="absmiddle">, is substantially higher than when the tax
rate was 40 percent.
<!--l. 975--><p class="indent" >   Hence, it is useful to think of the eﬀects of raising the bequest tax by
considering three categories of consumers. The ﬁrst are those with lifetime wealth
less than <img

unaﬀected by the tax increase. The second region is those consumers with lifetime
wealth between <img 
src="Why49x.svg" alt="ω1   " class="math";align="absmiddle"> and <img 
src="Why50x.svg" alt="ω2   " class="math";align="absmiddle">. These are the consumers who would leave bequests
if the bequest tax were only 40 percent, but prefer to consume all of their lifetime
wealth when the bequest tax rises. Finally, consumers with lifetime wealth greater
                                                                          

                                                                          
than <img 
src="Why51x.svg" alt="ω2   " class="math";align="absmiddle"> will leave bequests even when the bequest tax is 80 percent.
However, at any level of lifetime wealth the size of the bequests they leave is
reduced by an amount equal to the gap between the two consumption
curves. It is simple to show that as lifetime wealth goes to inﬁnity the
fraction of lifetime wealth bequeathed approaches 100 percent even with
the higher bequest taxes. This is the region of the model presumably
corresponds best to the circumstances of fabulously wealthy people like Bill
Gates.

consumers across the diﬀerent levels of lifetime income, the aggregate eﬀect of
bequest taxes in this model is impossible to judge in the absence of evidence (or
assumptions) about the distribution of lifetime income (and information about
the parameters of the model). If most bequests come from people with
<img

consumers with very large amounts of lifetime income, increasing the

bequests.

aversion for the residual value function is the same as for the period utility
function, and they do not incorporate a Stone-Geary term like my <img

<!--l. 1033--><p class="noindent" >A variety of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, strongly suggests that
people at the top end of the wealth and income distributions behave in ways that
are substantially diﬀerent from the behavior of most of the rest of the population.
In particular, it is diﬃcult to explain the behavior of these consumers using the
standard Life Cycle model of consumption. A leading alternative to (or perhaps
just an extension of) the Life Cycle model is the Dynastic model in which the
decisionmaker cares about the utility of his descendants. The Dynastic model,
however, has problems of its own, starting with the testimony of many
wealthy households who say that providing an inheritance is not a principal
motivation for saving and ending with the fact that childless wealthy old
people do not appear to dissave. I argue that the simplest model capable of
ﬁtting all the facts is a model in which wealth either enters the utility
function directly as a luxury good, or wealth yields a stream of services
that enter the utility function in ways that would be formally virtually
indistinguishable from a model in which wealth enters the utility function
directly.
<!--l. 1052--><p class="indent" >   In a way, the model reconciles Fitzgerald and Hemingway. Fitzgerald was right
that rich do not behave simply as scaled-up versions of everyone else.
They choose to save more and to accumulate faster because they can
“aﬀord” the luxury of doing so. But Hemingway was right to suggest that
the rest of us would probably behave the same way, if only we had more
money.
