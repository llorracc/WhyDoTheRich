  abstract =      {The paper presents a general theoretical framework
                   for the analysis of integrated life-cycle models of
                   consumption and family labor supply under
                   uncertainty. Profit functions are used to represent
                   intertemporally additive preferences and to yield
                   convenient characterizations of ``constant marginal
                   utility of wealth'' or ``Frisch'' demand functions.
                   Conditions on preferences derived that allow additive
                   fixed-effect specifications for the Frisch demands.
                   Data from the British Family Expenditure Surveys from
                   1970-77 are used to derive panel-like information on
                   male labor supply and consumption for several age
                   cohorts over time. These data reproduce standard
                   life-cycle patterns of hours and wages, but more
                   detailed analysis shows that the theory is incapable
                   of offering a satisfactory common explanation of the
                   behavior of hours and wages over both the business
                   cycle and the life cycle. Similarly, although the
                   theory can explain the life-cycle behavior of hours
                   and consumption separately, the same model cannot
                   explain both, essentially because of a failure in
                   symmetry.},
